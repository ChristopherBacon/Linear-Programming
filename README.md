# Linear-Programming Playlist
Using the Spotify API &amp; PULP to create a 90 minute noughties playlist. PULP is agreat python library for linear programming. Linear programming is an incredibly powerful tool for optimising business problems.

# Code

1. [Linear Programming Playlist Notebook](https://github.com/ChristopherBacon/Linear-Programming/blob/main/Spotify%20Linear%20Programming%20Playlist.ipynb) Notebook contains code to accesss the Spotify API, source playlist data and apply PULP optimisation to find best 00's playlist.

# Conclusion

This was a fun project, the first time that I had accessed Spotify data through the API using the Spoitpy library. Was really good to apply optimization techniques that I had learnt as part of my degree using the python optimization library PULP. However, I might try another project using Sci-Kit optimization module as this takes a lower level approach in that the user defines their matrices before setting up the problem. This is akin to the methods used throughout my OU degree. A future project in the making perhaps or an extension to this one.
